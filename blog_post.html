								Fortnite is an online shooter game where around 100 people are
								pitted against each other on a small island in a fight to the
								death until one person is left standing. A lot of time and in
								some cases money has been invested, particularly by the most
								hardcore players. so people are wondering if this is the end of
								Fortnite, or just the start of a new season of the game (a
								season lasts around 10 weeks).
							</p>
							<p>
								It’s so popular, particularly with kids, because it’s free, easy
								to use and doesn’t really take itself seriously with blood and
								gore and lots of things that you often get in other huge online
								games. Also, it’s kind of addictive.

								Epic Games reportedly makes up to about US$300m per month from
								it. That’s largely from players spending money in the game, on
								outfits and various items for their characters; as well as from
								the battle pass system, where people pay at least US$10 (or 950
								v-bucks, in the in-game currency) for challenges that allow them
								to unlock extra content.
							</p>
							<p>
								In terms of how much people invest in the game, it’s less of an
								issue than loot boxes (where people pay real money for mystery
								in-game prizes) – but a law firm in Canada recently launched a
								lawsuit against Epic Games, claiming Fortnite operated in a
								similar way to slot machines, and was as addictive as cocaine.
							</p>
							<p>
								In July, people competed for US $30m in prize money at the
								<span>Fortnite world cup</span> – and you’ve probably seen some
								of the memes for Fortnite without even realising. Do you
								remember Ted Danson flossing? Yeah that’s Fortnite.
